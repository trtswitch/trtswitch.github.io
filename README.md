  - Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time (RPSFT)
  - Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighting (IPCW)
  - Iterative Parameter Estimation (IPE)
  - Two-Stage Estimation (TSE)
  - Marginal Structural Models (MSM)
- **Seminars & Events**: Information about upcoming presentations and workshops
- **Resources**: Code repositories, publications, and educational materials
- **Interactive Table of Contents**: Dynamic navigation for easy content browsing

## Technology Stack

- **Static Site Generator**: Jekyll 4.x
