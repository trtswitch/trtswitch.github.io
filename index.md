# Welcome to the Oncology Treatment Switch Workstream

This workstream is formed to address a major challenge in oncology clinical trials, namely the impact of treatment switch on long-term outcomes.

<button class="collapsible">üìã Objectives</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>Treatment switching is a common occurrence in oncology clinical trials and is characterized by patients switching from control therapy to treatment therapy or vice versa during a clinical study. The occurrence of treatment switching amongst a large number of patients confounds and complicates a standard ITT based analysis of treatment efficacy, especially for long term outcomes such as overall survival and adjuvant-based disease-free survival.</p>
  
  <p>In the past decade of rapid oncology development for immuno-based and targeted-based therapies, treatment switching has been a regular occurrence in clinical trials and has led to several key oncologic drug advisory committee meetings. Yet, the topic has received only limited development in the academic and methodologic space and no organized group has yet emerged to bring a structured foundation for future research endeavors.</p>
  
  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <p>In order to help standardize and promote treatment switching methodological research and ideas, we propose to start a Treatment Switch workstream with membership from FDA, academic, and industry leaders involved in methodology in this space.</p>
  
  <h3>Three Major Goals and Initiatives</h3>
  
  <h4>üìñ Tutorial</h4>
  <p>To write and publish a tutorial for treatment switching in the peer-reviewed journal Statistics in Medicine. Have received early feedback from editor Paul Albert that the journal would welcome the approach, but need to go through standard peer-review process via associate editor.</p>
  <p><strong>Leads:</strong> Jing Xu (Takeda), Ananya Roy (Merck)</p>
  
  <h4>üî¨ Trial Implementation</h4>
  <p>To do fundamental research on practical matters related to treatment switching and its occurrence in clinical trials. Topics to include simulations on the effect of crossover, proposals for how to pre-specify such analyses in protocols, methods and literature reviews on subsequent therapies.</p>
  <p><strong>Leads:</strong> Ray Lin (Genentech), Yufei Wang (GSK)</p>
  
  <h4>üíª Code Standardization</h4>
  <p>Goal is to work towards a well-rounded repository of code with examples to implement most standard models for such work.</p>

## About This Workstream

The ASA Biopharmaceutical Section's Oncology Treatment Switch Workstream brings together statisticians, clinicians, and regulatory experts to tackle one of the most challenging aspects of modern clinical trials: **treatment switching**.

When patients switch from their assigned treatment to another therapy (often due to disease progression or safety concerns), traditional intent-to-treat analyses may not provide the most relevant estimates of treatment efficacy. Our workstream develops, validates, and promotes statistical methods that can properly adjust for this switching while maintaining scientific rigor.

**Why This Matters:**
- Treatment switching is increasingly common in oncology trials
- Regulatory agencies need robust methods for evaluation
- Patients and clinicians need clear efficacy estimates
- Statistical community needs validated, accessible tools

Join us in advancing the science of treatment switching analysis!
