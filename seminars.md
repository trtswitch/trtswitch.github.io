  <h3>Adjusting for Time-Varying Treatment Switches in Randomized Clinical Trials: The Danger of Extrapolation and How to Address It</h3>
  <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Hege Michiels, Argenx</p>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 3rd, 2024</p>
  <p><strong>Paper:</strong> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/usbr20" target="_blank">Statistics in Biopharmaceutical Research</a></p>
 
  
  <h4>Abstract:</h4>
  <p>When choosing estimands and estimators in randomized clinical trials, caution is warranted, as intercurrent events, such as patients who switch treatment after disease progression, are often strongly associated with patients' time-varying prognostic factors. Consequently, for patients who did experience intercurrent events, there are typically no comparable patients who did not. Statistical analyses may then easily lure one into making large implicit extrapolations, which often go unnoticed.</p>
  
  <p>We illustrate this problem of implicit extrapolations using a real oncology case study, with a right-censored time-to-event endpoint, in which patients can cross over from the control to the experimental treatment after disease progression, for ethical reasons. We address this by developing an estimator for the survival risk ratio contrasting the survival probabilities at each time t if all patients would take experimental treatment with the survival probabilities at those times t if all patients would take control treatment up to time t, using randomization as an instrumental variable to avoid reliance on no unmeasured confounders assumptions.</p>

  <h3>Structural Cumulative Survival Models for Estimation of Treatment Effects Accounting for Treatment Switching in Randomized Experiments</h3>
  <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Professor Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen, University of Pennsylvania</p>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> February 27th, 2024 | <strong>Time:</strong> 1:30 – 3:00 PM EST</p>
  <p><strong>Paper:</strong> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biometrics" target="_blank">Biometrics | Oxford Academic</a></p>

  
  <h4>Abstract:</h4>
  <p>Treatment switching in a randomized controlled trial occurs when a patient in one treatment arm switches to another arm during follow-up. This can occur at the point of disease progression, whereby patients in the control arm may be offered the experimental treatment. It is widely known that failure to account for treatment switching can seriously bias the estimated treatment causal effect.</p>
  
  <p>In this paper, we aim to account for the potential impact of treatment switching in a reanalysis evaluating the treatment effect of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) on a safety outcome (time to first severe or worse sign or symptom) in participants receiving a new antiretroviral regimen that either included or omitted NRTIs in the optimized treatment that includes or omits NRTIs trial.</p>
  
  <p>We propose an estimator of a treatment causal effect for a censored time to event outcome under a structural cumulative survival model that leverages randomization as an instrumental variable to account for selective treatment switching. We establish that the proposed estimator is uniformly consistent and asymptotically Gaussian, with a consistent variance estimator.</p>
  
  <h4>Key Topics:</h4>

    <li>Structural cumulative survival models</li>
    <li>Treatment switching in randomized controlled trials</li>
    <li>Instrumental variable approaches</li>
    <li>Causal inference for time-to-event outcomes</li>
    <li>Application to antiretroviral therapy trials</li>
