  <h4>Abstract:</h4>
  <p>Treatment switching in a randomized controlled trial occurs when a patient in one treatment arm switches to another arm during follow-up. This can occur at the point of disease progression, whereby patients in the control arm may be offered the experimental treatment. It is widely known that failure to account for treatment switching can seriously bias the estimated treatment causal effect.</p>
  <p>In this paper, we aim to account for the potential impact of treatment switching in a reanalysis evaluating the treatment effect of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) on a safety outcome (time to first severe or worse sign or symptom) in participants receiving a new antiretroviral regimen that either included or omitted NRTIs in the optimized treatment that includes or omits NRTIs trial.</p>
  <p>We propose an estimator of a treatment causal effect for a censored time to event outcome under a structural cumulative survival model that leverages randomization as an instrumental variable to account for selective treatment switching. We establish that the proposed estimator is uniformly consistent and asymptotically Gaussian, with a consistent variance estimator.</p>

  <h3>Multiple Imputation Approach in Causal Inference for Overall Survival in Randomized Controlled Trials with Crossover</h3>

  <h4>Abstract:</h4>
  <p>Crossover or treatment switching in randomized controlled trials presents notable challenges not only in the development and approval of new drugs but also poses a complex issue in their reimbursement, especially in oncology. When the investigational treatment is superior to control, crossover from control to investigational treatment upon disease progression or for other reasons will likely cause the underestimation of treatment benefit.</p>
  
  <p>Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time (RPSFT) and Two-Stage Estimation (TSE) methods are commonly employed to adjust for treatment switching by estimating counterfactual survival times. However, these methods may induce informative censoring by adjusting censoring times for switchers while leaving those for non-switchers unchanged. Existing approaches such like re-censoring or inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) are often used alongside RPSFT or TSE to handle informative censoring, but may result in long-term information loss or suffer from model misspecification.</p>
  
  <p>In this research, Kaplan-Meier multiple imputation with Bootstrap procedure (KMIB) is proposed to address the informative censoring issues in adjustment methods for treatment switching. This approach can avoid information loss and is robust to model misspecification. In the scenarios that we investigate, simulation studies show that this approach performs better than other adjustment methods when the treatment effect is small, and behave similarly under other scenarios despite different switching probability. A case study in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is also provided to demonstrate the use of this method.</p>

  <h3>Adjusting for Time-Varying Treatment Switches in Randomized Clinical Trials: The Danger of Extrapolation and How to Address It</h3>

  <h4>Abstract:</h4>
  <p>When choosing estimands and estimators in randomized clinical trials, caution is warranted, as intercurrent events, such as patients who switch treatment after disease progression, are often strongly associated with patients' time-varying prognostic factors. Consequently, for patients who did experience intercurrent events, there are typically no comparable patients who did not. Statistical analyses may then easily lure one into making large implicit extrapolations, which often go unnoticed.</p>
  
  <p>We illustrate this problem of implicit extrapolations using a real oncology case study, with a right-censored time-to-event endpoint, in which patients can cross over from the control to the experimental treatment after disease progression, for ethical reasons. We address this by developing an estimator for the survival risk ratio contrasting the survival probabilities at each time t if all patients would take experimental treatment with the survival probabilities at those times t if all patients would take control treatment up to time t, using randomization as an instrumental variable to avoid reliance on no unmeasured confounders assumptions.</p>
