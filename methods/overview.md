#Hypothetical Strategy in the Estimand Framework
Under the estimand framework, treatment switching is considered as intercurrent event. A hypothetical strategy is employed when research question of interest is in the survival benefit of an investigational drug versus a control treatment, assuming that subsequent therapies are not available or that patients would not switch to alternative treatments. This strategy aims to estimate the effect of the initially assigned treatment unconfounded by later therapies via the estimation of the "counterfactual" survival time (i.e., the survival time that would have been observed had the patient not switched treatments). This strategy is especially useful when those subsequent therapies are not yet approved or would not otherwise be accessible to the control arm.
This website includes a few most commonly used methods that are aligned with the hypothetical strategy, including Rank Preserved Survival Failure Time (RPSFT), Iterative Parameter Estimation (IPE), Inverse Probability Censoring Weighting (IPCW), Two-stage estimation (TSE), and Marginal Structural Model (MSM)
