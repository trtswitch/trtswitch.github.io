# Iterative Parameter Estimation (IPE)

## Overview
The iterative parameter estimation (IPE) method is very similar to the rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFT) method.  to adjust for treatment switching within a counterfactual framework. Both methods assume a common treatment effect. However, the two methods differ in how the accelerated parameter $\psi$ is estimated: the IPE method iteratively fits a parametric survival model until the estimate of $\psi$ converges whereas RPSFT uses g-estimation to find the optimal value of $\psi$.
